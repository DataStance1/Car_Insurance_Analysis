# Car_Insurance_Analysis

-This is an analysis of Car Insurance Data to gain insights into the relationship between customer demographics, car information and use and claim frequency and amount.

-This data set was provided by Data DNA for the Onyx Data Challenge for the month of August. It is an insurance company's customer data. Data consists of information about the customer, the car, the car use, claim
frequency and claim amount

- I took a stepwise approach in the analysis where I broke the exploratory data analysis into univariate, bivariate and multivariate exploratory data analysis.
- I built a summary dashboard to capture key findings of the analysis
